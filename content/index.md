# glitchassassin's digital garden

This is a living curation of knowledge, centered around topics I am interested in. Unlike a blog or traditional website, this is not designed to be static: pages in the garden will change and update as I learn or reconsider ideas. Feel free to revisit this garden from time to time to see what has changed.
