# Infrastructure

Structures will be considered from three angles: planning, building, and repairing.

## Room Planning

The goal of room planning is to optimize placement of structures based on the competing priorities of economy and defense.

## Building

Structures should generally be built as soon as they come available at a given RCL. There are a few exceptions:

1. Drop-mining containers (remote or in-room) generally don't need to be built before RCL3. Containers reduce loss, but getting to reservers will boost income and so extensions are a higher priority. Once income is being maximized with reservers, roads & containers at sources will reduce losses and improve hauler efficiency.
2. The initial three labs are not very useful at RCL6 - it's probably worth waiting until RCL7 when you can build six instead

## Repairing

Some structures decay
