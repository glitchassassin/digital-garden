# Securing Remotes

## Invaders

Invader cores will harass remotes, reserving the controller to lock the sources from being harvested. These are easy to defend against; they do not attack, so a simple guard creep with a pattern of 1A/1M can kill them with no trouble.

## Other Bots

Harassment from other bots can be more expensive. If it costs more to defend a remote than the energy it brings in, it may be more economical to simply abandon the remote until it can be safely harvested again.

I began by measuring the energy spent on a remote (spawning, defense, repairing roads/containers, etc.) and comparing it to the energy brought back. However, my experience in SWC 212 showed that this takes too much time to present, and doesn't accurately reflect the danger of harassers.

Rather than tracking on a per-room basis, we need to track the zone that an enemy is willing and able to harass. Then we need to evaluate the cost to protect our creeps from harassment, and determine if the remotes are worth the cost.
