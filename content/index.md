# Welcome to the Garden

Layout should have...

- Reset styles
- Simple textured background (perhaps with organic curves?)
- Interesting (but easily readable) typography
- Primary color for emphasis (underlines, e.g.) - variant of natural green (perhaps with gradient)
- Sensible mobile breakpoints
- Code highlighting
