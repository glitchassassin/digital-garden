# Infrastructure

Structures will be considered from three angles: planning, building, and repairing.

## Room Planning

The goal of room planning is to optimize placement of structures based on the competing priorities of economy and defense.

## Building

Structures should generally be built as soon as they come available at a given RCL. There are a few exceptions:

1. Drop-mining containers (remote or in-room) generally don't need to be built before RCL3. Containers reduce loss, but getting to reservers will boost income and so extensions are a higher priority. Once income is being maximized with reservers, roads & containers at sources will reduce losses and improve hauler efficiency.
2. The initial three labs are not very useful at RCL6 - it's probably worth waiting until RCL7 when you can build six instead. See [discussion in #botarena.](https://discord.com/channels/860665589738635336/865974501505237022/1002953782407221308)

Barriers (walls and ramparts) can have a maximum of 300M hitpoints, but it usually makes sense to maintain these at a lower threshold. 

## Repairing

Some structures decay with time and/or use: roads, containers, and ramparts. Other structures take damage when attacked by enemy creeps, invaders, or nukes.

Maintenance generally ought to be prioritized above new construction. Otherwise,
